# Portfolio

I took a strange approach to this page. The website itself is like one of the portfolio artifacts. I made some sort of interactive game-like word reveal activity where I probably should have put a navigation header.

On mobile the github repository objects collapse into a carousel-type element that scales better on mobile devices. 

work is ongoing on this project.

## TODO:
* add social media links to the page
* transform helloHeader to navbar, change word reveal behavior to be mouseover text on browser, remove the text change behavior
* add an "about me" page or section
* troubleshoot compatitbility with different browsers
