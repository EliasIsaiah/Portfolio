# Portfolio

This is my Portfolio website, just a medium for my various projects that I work on. It utilizes a basic GitHub API call to display all of my public repos at the bottom, and showcases a few projects I'm particularly proud of at this time.

### What makes it unique

For better or for worse, I decided to make this website without the use of css framewoks like materialize or bootstrap.

All styling done on the site is done with vanilla CSS, utilizing relative newcomers to the technology like Grid CSS and Flexbox to create a responsive layout that is lightweight and modern.

### A Couple Pros and Cons re: using/not using CSS Frameworks

Pros:
* Complete Creative Control

    When you do not use a framework you have complete creative control over your project. There is no opinionated framework making decision for you about spacing, colors, components, etc.

* Lightweight (potentially)
  
    If you have a simple one page project that mostly functions as a view displaying some content, there is a good chance that importing a css framework will include a lot of unneeded code onto your project. The performance ramifications of this are not felt in most use cases, but they are still present and worth a thought.

Cons:

* Complete Creative Control
  
  Materialize and Bootstrap do a good job of providing ready to use components that work accross all devices, without any tweaking needed. There's a reason they exist, it is just a pain to manually write CSS for a project that has to meet production standards.

* A lot more code writing
  
  This sort of ties in with the first con, but you are just going to have to write a lot more markup if you don't use a framework, and more javascript as well if you want javascript enabled interaction on your website.

### The Best Solution

The best solution (in most scenarios) really is a combination product. Use a CSS Framework to take care of the basic components and compatibility that it offers, and then customize it to deliver the look and feel that you want. 

That's not always easy, but if you can learn to work within the limitations and quirks of your framework you will build a better and more functionanl website. Besides - working within constraints is what real world web development is all about anyways.
