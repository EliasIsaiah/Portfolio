# Portfolio

I took a strange approach to this assignment. The website itself is like one of the portfolio artifacts. I made some sort of interactive game-like word reveal activity where I probably should have put a navigation header.

On mobile the github repository objects collapse into a carousel-type element that scales better on mobile devices. 

work is ongoing on this project.

## TODO:
* add social media links to the page
* add an "about me" page or section
* troubleshoot compatitbility with different browsers
